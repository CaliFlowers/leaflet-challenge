## Geomapping with Leaflet 

Geo-mapping is probably one of the most versatile applications of data. It is often said that geography is destiny; and data on a range of indices seem to support that assertion. Geo-mapping combines data with one's sense of space. 
If data visualization helps condense data into a comprehensible, understable form, geo-mapping helps make data meaningful to us based on our understanding of geographical space. 

Leaflet is the Javascript library that specializes in rendering data on maps. 

## GeoJSON
In data visualization, the dimension of position is considered the most salient. 
In Leaflet, information nn position typically comes defined in a GeoJSON format. GeoJSON stores the attributes of a location in Javascript Object Notation (JSON) format. This makes it possible to define various types of objects on a map: lines, borders, points, cities, landmarks, shapes, geographic regions, Data can be embedded in a GeoJSON format as well to make it easier to display data related to specific geographical features.

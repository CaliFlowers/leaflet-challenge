## Geomapping with Leaflet 

Geo-mapping is probably one of the most versatile applications of data. It is often said that geography is destiny; and data on a range of indices seem to support that assertion. Geo-mapping combines data with one's sense of space. 
If data visualization helps condense data into a comprehensible, understable form, geo-mapping helps make data meaningful to us based on our understanding of geographical space. 

Leaflet is the Javascript library that specializes in rendering data on maps.
